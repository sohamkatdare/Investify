    header='EBITDA', 
    text="EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is an alternate measure of profitability to net income. By stripping out the non-cash depreciation and amortization expense as well as taxes and debt costs dependent on the capital structure, EBITDA attempts to represent cash profit generated by the companys operations."

  {{ macros.section(
    header='Recognition under GAAP', 
    text="EBITDA is not a metric recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Some public companies report EBITDA in their quarterly results along with adjusted EBITDA figures typically excluding additional costs, such as stock-based compensation. However, the increased focus on EBITDA by companies and investors has prompted claims that it overstates profitability. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires listed companies reporting EBITDA figures to show how they were derived from net income, and it bars them from reporting EBITDA on a per-share basis."
    ) }}

  {{ macros.section(
    header='Calculation', 
    text="If a company doesnt report EBITDA, it can be easily calculated from its financial statements. The earnings (net income), tax, and interest figures are found on the income statement, while the depreciation and amortization figures are normally found in the notes to operating profit or on the cash flow statement. The usual shortcut for calculating EBITDA is to start with operating profit, also called earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), then add back depreciation and amortization."

    ) }}

  {{ macros.section(
    header='Purpose and Use', 
    text="EBITDA is net income (earnings) with interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization added back. EBITDA can be used to track and compare the underlying profitability of companies regardless of their depreciation assumptions or financing choices. Like earnings, EBITDA is often used in valuation ratios, notably in combination with enterprise value as EV/EBITDA, also known as the enterprise multiple."
  
    ) }}

  {{ macros.section(
    header='Use in Specific Industries', 
    text="EBITDA is especially widely used in the analysis of asset-intensive industries with a lot of property, plant, and equipment and correspondingly high non-cash depreciation costs. In those sectors, the costs that EBITDA excludes may obscure changes in the underlying profitability—for example, as for energy pipelines. Meanwhile, amortization is often used to expense the cost of software development or other intellectual property. That’s one reason why early-stage technology and research companies use EBITDA when discussing their performance."

  {{ macros.section(
    header='Origins and Criticisms', 
    text="EBITDA was the invention of Liberty Media Chair John Malone in the 1970s to help sell lenders and investors on his leveraged growth strategy, which deployed debt and reinvested profits to minimize taxes. During the 1980s, the investors and lenders involved in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) found EBITDA useful in estimating whether the targeted companies had the profitability to service the debt likely to be incurred in the acquisition.
    However, EBITDA gained notoriety during the dotcom bubble, when some companies used it to exaggerate their financial performance. The metric received more bad publicity in 2018 after WeWork Companies Inc., a provider of shared office space, filed a prospectus for its initial public offering (IPO) defining its “Community Adjusted EBITDA” as excluding general and administrative expenses and other costs, drawing criticism from analysts and investors."
