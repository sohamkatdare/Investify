    header='What is volume ®', 
    text="In financial markets, volume refers to the total number of shares or contracts traded within a specific time frame. It represents the overall activity and liquidity in a particular security or market. Volume is typically measured and displayed as a histogram on trading charts. Each bar on the chart corresponds to a specific time period, such as a day, hour, or minute, and its height represents the number of shares or contracts traded during that interval."

    header='Why is Volume Important?', 
    text=`Volume acts as a confirmation tool for price movements. When a security experiences a significant price increase or decrease accompanied by high volume, it suggests that there is broad market participation, validating the strength and direction of the price movement. Conversely, low-volume moves may indicate a lack of conviction and potentially unreliable price trends. High volume ensures liquidity in the market, allowing traders to enter and exit positions more easily at desired prices. Thinly traded securities with low volume can have wider bid-ask spreads, making it harder to execute trades without impacting the price. Understanding volume can help investors identify liquid markets that offer efficient execution. Volume plays a vital role in identifying trends and potential reversals. During an uptrend, increasing volume suggests strong buying interest, indicating a continuation of the upward movement. Similarly, in a downtrend, rising volume during price declines signifies sustained selling pressure. Conversely, declining volume during a price reversal can hint at a potential change in market sentiment.
    Volume can help validate support and resistance levels. When a security approaches a significant price level, high volume during a breakout or breakdown can confirm the strength of the move and the relevance of the support or resistance level. Increased volume near these levels can indicate increased buying or selling interest, providing valuable insights for investors.
    Volume analysis can also reveal divergences or convergences between price and volume. Divergence occurs when the price moves in one direction while volume moves in the opposite direction, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Conversely, convergence happens when price and volume move in the same direction, reinforcing the strength of the prevailing trend.
